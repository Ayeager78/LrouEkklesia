The following is just a place to gather my thought regarding "Events" in the database.  I needed a place to gather and try
to organize my thoughts on how to handle them.

Events are/can be....
    Classes (Sunday School, membership, other)
    Group gatherings (Small Groups, Youth, other)
    Conferences (Love & Respect, other)
    Training

Events can occur...
    1 time
    multiple times  ?These should be separate events?
        varied occurrence
        repeat scheduled occurrence

Event attendance tracking can be...
    strictly (per person basis)
    loosely (just count)
    none (no tracking at all)

Event "ownership"...
    Events can be "owned" (responsible for) by...
        person
        group
        ?both?
    ownership should be changeable
    ?Should allow more than one concurrent owner?
