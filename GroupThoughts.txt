Here is my organizing place for thoughts on Groups


Groups are groupings of people for certain things like Sunday School each Group may or may not be Sub grouped.
Even subgroups could have subgroups

For example, with Sunday School could be a group, while each individual class would be a group (elementary, Adult, etc...)
also it would have the parent Group of Sunday School.  This would make the Elementary class a child group of the Sunday School
Group.

Another example might be Deacon care groups.  The Parent(base) group could be Deacon Care group.  With a child for each Deacon.
People under the care of this deacon could be added to that group.  If the deacon chose he could create another group or
groups under his group to kind of categorize the members of his group.  This is probably an example that is stretching this
need a little to much but it does show the possability that could happen with Parents, children, grandchildren, and maybe
even further as needed.  There should likely be some sort of limit to the depth of groupings.  BUt for the time being it
is/will be unlimited.


Groups can be/are
    Departments (Childrens, Adults, Seniors, Outreach, Missions)
    Organizations
    Ministry areas
    Classes
